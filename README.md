# extensions
A simple Python program that outputs a fileâ€™s media (MIME) type based on its extension. Handles input case-insensitively and trims whitespace. Supports .gif, .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .pdf, .txt, and .zip; defaults to application/octet-stream.
Includes pytest tests in test_extensions.py to verify correct MIME mapping and edge cases.
